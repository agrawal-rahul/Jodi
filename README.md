# Introduction
Software development is a form of human expression and provides creative satisfaction like any other art form. We would like many to 
embrace and experience the fun of development by working in a distributed connected collaborative learning setup by creating expressions,
reading other's creations and learning by critique. Since the field of computer science is beyond comprehension even in multiple lifespans,
we would like to focus on specific aspect of this beautiful field -- "implementing machine learning".

# Objectives
1. Encourage a structured learning plan
2. Stress on theoretical understanding and continuous implementation
3. Strongly encourage reading, reviewing, and critiquing others code
4. Strong focus on understanding the implementation along with modeling

# Books
1. A First Course in Probability - Sheldon M. Ross
2. Statistics - David Freedman and Robert Pisani
3. Linear Algebra - Gilbert Strang
4. Convex Optimization - Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe (Some Parts)
5. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning - Christopher Bishop
6. Machine learning: a Probabilistic Perspective - Kevin Murphy
7. Introduction to Algorithms - Thomas E. Cormen
8. Mining of Massive Datasets - Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, Jeffrey D. Ullman
9. Papers which will be implemneted as projects

# Prerequisites
1. Knowledge of Python, C, C++

# Suggested Readings for prerequisites
1. Learning Python - Mark Lutz
2. C++ Primer - Stanley B. Lipmman, Jos√©e Lajoie, Barbara E. Moo
3. C Programming Language - Brian Kernighan, Dennis Ritchie

# How it Works
We will start with a group that signs up for the learning. The participants are supposed to self read the content and can ask questions.
The content read has to be implemented in parallel and the code review raised here in a branch. You get points for your assignments and
also reading solutions from others.

It must be noted that this is a collaborative learning setuo and hence the success depends on every one contributing. Secondly, as objective number 3 suggests, reading others code is a requirement, and so does writing code. If you fail to do either of them repeatedly, you will be removed from the program. You can continue to follow the repository but you will cease to be the part of it.

In the first instance of this program, the **number of participants will be restricted to 100 at max.**

# Commitment
1. Atleast 25 hours per week

# Costing
I am not going to charge anything for whatever efforts I will put it. At the end, if you feel that you derived some value out of it, 
please donate amount of your wish to your favorite charity and send me a note so that I can acknowledge you _for making the world 
a better place_.

# Questions

## Will I be teaching ?
No. I cannot commit time for teaching right now. I will be helping out with the questions and also trying to facilitate and moderate
the process. The participants have to self-study but the milestones and the organization will be handled by me so that the whole 
process is streamlined. 

# Acknowledgements
I would like to extend my acknowledgements to the following folks, who helped in shaping up the above initiative -
